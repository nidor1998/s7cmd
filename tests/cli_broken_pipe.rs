//! Process-level broken-pipe regression tests. No AWS access is needed:
//! completions, help, and version never leave the process, presign signs
//! locally with dummy static credentials, the batch-run script is empty,
//! and the get-bucket-versioning report comes from a loopback
//! [`MockS3Server`].
//!
//! Each test hands the child a stdout (or stderr) whose read end is already
//! closed, so every write to it fails with `BrokenPipe` from the first
//! byte — the worst case of piping to a consumer that exits without
//! reading, such as `s7cmd --auto-complete-shell bash | head 1` (`head`
//! treats `1` as a file name, fails to open it, and never reads its input)
//! or `head -1`/`grep -q`/a pager closed early. The binary must exit
//! through its normal paths: never panic ("failed printing to stdout:
//! Broken pipe" / "failed to write completion file") and never die of
//! SIGPIPE (which would surface here as `status.code() == None`).
//!
//! The tracing-writer counterpart (`PipeSafeWriter` on a closed stderr
//! during offline-failing commands) is pinned by `cli_closed_stderr.rs`.
